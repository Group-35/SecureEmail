To build the project you will need a linux operating system. 
Once you have that install Ruby (version 2.2 or higher) and Rails 4.2. Afterwards get the project and run these commands:

rake db:migrate
rails s

That should build the database and run the server locally. Alternatively you can go to https://salty-depths-8905.herokuapp.com to view the site online.
